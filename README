pyjab is a tool to control purple-powered IM clients (such as pidgin) from other programs using dbus.

Supported clients are:
 - zsh, bash or any other shell;
 - emacs.

It comes with autocompletion for zsh.

To use pyjab, you need to have on your system:
 - a recent release of Python
 - a recent release of dbus-python

You can define aliases for people you want to send messages to, by creating a file named “.pyjabrc” in your $HOME directory.
The format is as follow:

----8<-----
# This is a comment
alias=realname
alias=realname
# This is a comment
alias=realname
----8<-----
